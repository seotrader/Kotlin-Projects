This app demonstrades the use of the following Androind technologies via Kotlin:

1. Retrofit to read a remote JSON files via the API https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/
2. Using RXJAVA2 to make the Retrofit calls
3. MVVM structure with ViewModel class
4. Glide to read the images efficiently 
5. Using CardView and RecycleView to show the list of charecters
6. Reloading more images when user scroll to the end of the list
7. OFFLINE / ONLINE MODE, saving the charecters and images to DBS via ROOM

Cheers !
